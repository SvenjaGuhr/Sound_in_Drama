            It was in March between Okuli and Lätare. The Count and Countess had taken up residence in their newly refurbished flat in the Fichtenberg forester's lodge to make the most of the snipe raid. Many of the winged travellers who had sought refuge in the damp lowlands of the coniferous forests succumbed. The bloodier the day had been, the happier the hunters returned home, and the more graciously the head forester was invited to dinner. The small party ate their meal in a cosy wood-panelled room, which was almost overheated by a strongly heated tiled stove and rather sparsely lit by the four candles of a female deer chandelier.

The events of the day had provided the material for table talk. <character_sound>Over black coffee, the Count began to praise the state of the woodlands in his broad and extremely good-natured manner</character_sound>. "There is a difference," <character_sound>he said</character_sound>, "between mine and the princely ones where we hunted in autumn."

They smoked; the countess, who had lit her largest cigar, suddenly jumped up, ran to the window, opened it wide <character_sound>and said</character_sound>, steaming like a little chimney: "All is well with you, my dear Mr Ruppert, only your people are not. The servants fire one out of the room and your hunters - a clan... my grandfather would say: 'As if the pigeons had brought it together'."

"Yes, yes, she's right," <character_sound>said the Count</character_sound>, "I was looking at the hunting staff today. These people look like robbers."

The head forester's face lengthened. "High Count's Grace can change that in a moment, just give the order, that is. We'll just take a leaf out of the princely hunters' book: they wear uniforms with silver buttons and braids and wash their hands twice a day."

"What are you changing into, Ruppert - I only meant that," <character_sound>the count appeased</character_sound>, <character_sound>and his wife intervened</character_sound>: "It wasn't about washing your hands, but that the people are so strange. One of them walked behind me all day, a skinny, brown man, a rather scary one with defiant eyes."

"The Gruber, Your Grace."

"He can't even talk."

"With his mouth, no, <character_sound>but I humbly request</character_sound> that you just take a look at his crops on the Reiterberg, because they speak instead of him."

"But you haven't given me an answer, <character_sound>as I asked</character_sound>," <character_sound>said the countess</character_sound>, opening her wonderful, black-brown eyes mischievously at the old man.

He didn't understand her: "What do you mean?"

"Listen to me.
I've been to a place in the forest that I've never seen before. There are really big spruce trees there, and a narrow meadow - <ambient_sound>small springs trickle through it</ambient_sound> - stretches down to the valley village.

You can see the church tower and the cross on top. There at the edge of the forest I notice a green hill, long and narrow, completely bordered with snowflowers. 'You', <character_sound>I say</character_sound>, 'you, hunter, what's that?' - 'What?' <character_sound>he says</character_sound>, tying one of the snipes he has tied to his forest bag. 'Isn't that a grave, a poor, lonely grave?' - 'Maybe', <character_sound>he mumbles, so quietly</character_sound> that I barely understood. He tugs at his thick moustache... just like you're doing now, dear Ruppert, Mr Chief Forester," <character_sound>she burst out laughing</character_sound>.

He quickly lowered his hand, <character_sound>and the countess continued</character_sound>: "Next to the grave - as if not daring to come any closer, there is a cross made of two thin slats, held together in the middle by a bent nail, and there is a name on it: Resel. You can still make it out, even though the letters are half blurred by the rain and as crooked as if a child had written them."

"Not a child," <character_sound>said the forester</character_sound>, "but one who has become like a child... The high count's grace still knew him," he turned to the count, "the old Vitalis, the tall, fat one with the rose-coloured face."

"Yes - yes - and I always wanted to say mass when he came to the castle. What patience he had with me!"

"But Resel, why isn't she buried in the cemetery?" <character_sound>asked the countess</character_sound>, <character_sound>and the forester replied hesitantly</character_sound>: "Yes, unfortunately, because she unfortunately laid a hand on herself, namely killed herself."

"Killed herself!" <character_sound>cried the young woman excitedly</character_sound> - "certainly out of unhappy love, she wasn't allowed to marry her lover, or he abandoned her, the rascal... Is that so? Tell me if you know."

"How could I not? After all, Resel was my brother's daughter."

"So - and what was he?"

"Miller in the valley village."

"Did he have many children?"

"None at all for the longest time, then Resel came along. The good Lord came to his senses. <character_sound>But because they didn't rest with their pleas and begging in all the places of pilgrimage</character_sound>, he finally gave in and sent them the trembling joy."

"The child must have been sickly?"

"Healthy as a fisherman from birth. - 'When the two old people have a child, it's born with grey hair,' they used to say. Meanwhile, the girl has a head full of dark curls, and as she has lost them, even darker ones grow back. Her eyes were black-brown, I've never seen such beautiful ones in my life."

The countess shrugged her shoulders, stood up <character_sound>and said to her husband</character_sound> with comically naïve indignation: "Comme il est bête!"

<character_sound>The man addressed only replied with a sound of assent</character_sound>, for he was already half asleep. The young lady took a seat on the ottoman by the window pillar, leaning her neck on the cushions <character_sound>and asked</character_sound>: "Was the Resel tall, short, what did she look like?"

"She will have had a casual person like the High Countess, only not so skinny around there." - The forester put down his cigar and gripped his broad waist with both hands. "But a firebug. You never knew when she was away whether she'd bring her straight limbs home."

The countess smiled: "Yes, yes, there are such wild bumblebees, I knew one too."

"Her parents couldn't get out of their mortal fear for her, but they didn't want to show her that she wouldn't get hurt. Sometimes she realised on her own <character_sound>and said</character_sound>: 'Mother, I won't leave your side for eight days', sat down with her work and fiddled, fiddled! She wasn't lacking in good will, but it was completely against her nature, and when you saw her like that, she seemed like a finch or a canary that had been harnessed and had to pull a cart behind her. Her father couldn't stand the sad sight of her and always sent her away soon to dance in the meadows. She didn't just dance, she also helped people with the mowing and haymaking and in winter with the wood picking - if only she could be out in the open. And - curious girl! a passion for risking her life, as if she couldn't get rid of it soon enough."

<character_sound>His listener interrupted him eagerly</character_sound>: "No, no, she didn't think of that, she loved danger, it happens, even girls have heroic blood in their veins... Maybe her grandfather was a soldier like mine."

<character_sound>The forester nodded in agreement</character_sound>: "Could be... The Resel - to think that as a twelve-year-old thing she rescued a nappy-changing child from a burning house and would soon have drowned a few weeks later. She jumped into the water after a young dog that should have been drowned."

"A dog? - Forester, I would have done that once, by a hair! But the governess, the stupid goose, caught me by the dress and held me down... Go on, I already love her, Resel."

"Look, that's how every human being has been, and no different for the dear cattle. If she had come to us, do you think my dog would have gone to me? No idea. He jumped round her as if bewitched and never left her heels. And my eldest boy, Robert, is imitating him. Or at least wants to... She was sixteen at the time, he was eighteen. I hit him - it was no use. I had to send him to a friend in Saxony, where he had more to do and less to eat than at home. Plague and hunger, Your Grace, are the best remedies for love."

"Wasn't Resel sorry for him?"

"No. She went with her Toni and didn't care about anyone else. That is, I don't want to have said that; she was attached to her parents, to whom she was the most precious thing, and also to the old spiritual master, Vitalis. - Look, you could see from him what it's like when a single-minded person attaches his heart to a strange child. He does more with him than his own parents, believe me. - 'My baptised child, my confessor child', I can still hear the expression and: 'She has a head, she asks more cleverly than I can answer. Yes, and what a heart! It's just that she doesn't always show it. But how often it comes out of its own accord, for example - do you remember, forester? - If half a village had to burn down so that one could show its good heart, I thought - I said, no. I would have made a sin of offending the good, good gentleman. Resel was less sensitive on this point, and Father was also difficult to persuade to give her a warning. He was frightened by her remorse, which was there immediately, but didn't look much different from pure despair. So she fell to her knees before her parents and kissed their hands and feet <character_sound>and begged their forgiveness</character_sound> with wailing and weeping</character_sound>."

"Why then for forgiveness?"

"There must have been a reason, you know. The love affair with Toni was in full bloom, and the old people, weak as they otherwise were, didn't want to know anything about it."

"For what reason?"

"Firstly, he was barely twenty."

"Barely twenty!" The countess let her gaze rest on her husband's noble but no longer youthful features and on his bare bald head, which reflected the light of one of the lustful candles.

"Secondly," <character_sound>the forester added</character_sound>, "my brother was a wealthy man who could ask for something better for his daughter than a poor gamekeeper, which is what the lad was at the time. Heger in the Hubertushütten above. It's true that the father should have been clever earlier and not allowed Resel and Toni to run around together all the time from an early age. It turned out that way because the house of the gamekeeper, Toni's father, was not far from the mill and the only one in the neighbourhood."

"So they were playmates," <character_sound>said the countess seriously and thoughtfully</character_sound>, "and both young and funny, so they fell in love with each other."

"To serve, Your Grace. <character_sound>I have often told my brother</character_sound> that it was time he paid attention to her. For nothing. At most that he took offence and snapped at me: 'I can't run after her with my gout; it would be too bad for the effort. I dare her to do all sorts of things, but not one wrong thought. She'll get rid of her children's shoes and her stupidity with Toni all at once; just let Andreas be there."

"Who?"

"The landlord of the Fichtentann, his only one. Yes - the old people had long since chosen him as their son-in-law. He was due to arrive the following week after completing his military service. A splendid, good man."

"Yes," <character_sound>said the countess as if in a dream</character_sound>, "good and well behaved... but he was bald."

"Bald? that I do not know."

The young woman blushed all over and turned her somewhat shocked eyes to her husband, who was fast asleep. "All one thing," <character_sound>she said quickly</character_sound>, "go on."

"What else shall I tell you? - You can imagine the end; we've seen the poor thing's grave. She was buried there, of course, with the permission of the Most Eminent Count. As long as Father Vitalis was still alive, he tended the resting place of his baptised child. Then I always sent one of my boys out."

"Well, well, that will come later, now I want to know how Resel died."

<character_sound>The forester hesitated</character_sound>. "Don't ask, Your Grace, because it's a very sad story."

"But I want to know it," <character_sound>said the countess imperiously</character_sound> and lifted herself up a little on her elbow.

"Now you just looked like Resel," <character_sound>the old hunter remarked with a smile</character_sound>.

"So - when?"

"When she was made angry, and she easily became so against everyone except Toni; what he did was always right - for her. An unruly girl like that, and didn't dare open her eyes any other way than the way she pleased him."

"She just loved him."

"No matter how much fun they had at the dance, no matter how crazy the lads got with her, the fun was over immediately, just like Toni out of jealousy or something. With him, it was over in the blink of an eye."

"That's strange," <character_sound>said the countess</character_sound>, "that Toni was like that too."

"Very strange," <character_sound>confirmed the forester impartially</character_sound>. "A dear, handsome, jolly fellow has stepped up to the table; a wooden crested stick with a crooked mouth has sat down. If I were a girl, I wouldn't take anyone like that. Nothing else could be said against him; he was good at his trade, full of curash and like the devil at game-shooters and wood-thieves. But a mistress has nothing of that."

"She has that she likes it, and that's all."

"Excuse me, but one would like to know what reason she had for such a love."

"That's not the point, my dear Ruppert." She leant her head back and closed her eyes. "Go on, go on. - Well, shall I tell you one thing? - The other one is expected every hour and poor Resel is terribly upset: 'You take him, you must! - We want, <character_sound>we implore</character_sound> - the peace of our old days depends on it. - How gently we would die if we knew you in the care of a good man... Child, child, don't make death difficult for us.' - Is that how they spoke to her, the grandparents and Vitalis?"

"Please, there were no grandparents," <character_sound>said Ruppert, not without glee at the gap in his mistress's divinatory talent</character_sound>. "The spiritual master talked to her on behalf of her parents."

"And she gave in, poor thing?"

<character_sound>The forester swayed his head in concern</character_sound>: "God forgive her and give her eternal peace."

"How - so Resel stood firm and said no?"

"Not yes and not no, but completely desperate, I hear, <character_sound>wished her parents goodnight</character_sound>, and you should pray for her. - She left the room, came back in a few times, just as if she wanted to say something and didn't dare and couldn't get it out. <character_sound>After much pleading from her mother</character_sound> she finally goes to rest. 'Tomorrow we'll talk more,' <character_sound>says the father</character_sound>, and she, with a kind of mortal fear: 'If two pleas come, perhaps you'll have mercy then In a quarter of an hour the mother went to see, she was lying in bed asleep - or something like that. The next morning she was gone."

"She threw herself into the water or into an abyss," <character_sound>the countess explained with great certainty</character_sound>. "Well, she was able to do it, and there were no governesses to stop her."

"What do you mean - governesses? Of course there were none," <character_sound>said the forester faithfully</character_sound>. "But the common folk all said the same thing as Your Grace: She has killed herself one way or another, and the parents are still being told: If you have always let a child have its own way, you must not suddenly demand obedience from it. Those who mourn the suicide most bitterly need not first ask who caused it."

"Quite right," <character_sound>interjected the countess</character_sound>.

"The old men sat there as if they'd been struck by lightning. What do they care for gossip? The worst Bosnickel would not have invented such reproaches as they made to themselves. Mr Chaplain, who also needs consolation, gives it, at least try it. - <ambient_sound>There's a knock at the window</ambient_sound> and immediately afterwards at the door. The parents pull together; they can't help but think: Instead, the boy from the bakery comes in, who brings Toni bread twice a week. They shouldn't be offended, <character_sound>he says</character_sound>, Resel is alive, he's seen her, she's up in the Hubertushütten."

"Where?" - the eager listener flapped her hands <character_sound>and shouted with a mixture of rebuke and admiration</character_sound>: "Murderous girl that!"

"I was just visiting my son in Saxony," <character_sound>continued the narrator</character_sound>, "and only came back in the evening. The disaster had already happened - but before that a miracle. Just think, old Father Vitalis had set out on the path to the Heger and really travelled it. How he crawled over the rocks and scree, the ponderous gentleman with his wobbly legs, cannot be explained naturally. <character_sound>Afterwards I asked him</character_sound>: 'How were you able to overcome the difficulties of the hike?' - <character_sound>His answer was</character_sound>: 'I felt no difficulties, I was carried up by my great anger and my great pain." - In short, he enters the huts. In the kitchen by the hearth stands his 'baptised child, his confessor's child', clapping her hands to her face as she sees him, and weeping so that the tears flow through her fingers.

Where was his anger? Only his pain remained <character_sound>and spoke out of him</character_sound>: 'Godforsaken, do you know what you have done? Do you know if your parents will survive the shame?... Run away - you!... Why run away? - Speak up! There is your old confessor, confess!'

Well, my God and Lord, it was no different from the worst. <character_sound>She confessed</character_sound> that she could no longer stand being under the same roof as her good, deceived parents, that she could no longer hear: 'If you love us, you'll marry Andreas' - that she had run away here in her desperation. Today or tomorrow her parents must have learnt how things stood with her and -"

<character_sound>The countess interrupted him excitedly</character_sound>: "She lacked discipline, she lacked guidance. She stood there all alone, eye to eye with temptation... Poor Resel! -Of course, we know nothing of such a danger; we are spared the choice between right and wrong - the protectors follow us wherever we go. The constant surveillance often annoys us, but in the end it is happiness and mercy. - Oh, how good it is to have a clear conscience - no, to have one!... Go on, head forester, why do you interrupt yourself every now and then? What did he say now, the good Father Vitalis?"

"Well, <character_sound>he gave her the message from her parents</character_sound>. That she is forgiven and allowed to marry Toni, but that she has to leave her parents' house for the church and go straight back to her parents' house with him.

Resel was as if the sun had shone fiery red in her face at sunset, and a frost was said to have shaken her. 'My father,' <character_sound>she said</character_sound>, 'my mother, my good parents, my much too good ones! She has made the best of resolutions to repay them and atone a thousandfold for what she has done to them, and from now on to be the most grateful daughter, the most obedient. - 'By the grace of God,' <character_sound>said the chaplain</character_sound>, 'and now come Not yet; she forces him to drink a glass of goat's milk and then gives him an escort over half the mountain to where the road becomes good. There she stops, takes his hand and kisses it. 'Thank you, Reverend, and see you soon <character_sound>He is startled</character_sound>: 'What? Aren't you going straight away? She couldn't possibly come without Toni; it would be as if he didn't want to know anything more about her and was sending her home. They have both been absent, they must both ask for forgiveness and a blessing. The days are long now, <character_sound>she says</character_sound> - in early June - it is still light and she would like to wait until it gets dark. She arrives safely before going to bed, brings Toni with her, and when he has his reprieve, he should just leave right away, <character_sound>she swears</character_sound> that she doesn't even want to see him again before the altar at the wedding. She kisses the Father's hand once more, and before he can think twice, she has jumped up and away. - <ambient_sound>After a while, the air from on high gave the spiritual master a whoop</ambient_sound>, <ambient_sound>there was such a cheer</ambient_sound>, as if a poor soul was flying straight up from purgatory into heaven."

"Now everything could have been fine, forester."

"To serve, yes - could, that is, if Toni had been a whole man and not a half-hearted one who still can't resist a bad habit from his boyhood. He was, <character_sound>he told me</character_sound>, when I say twenty times, I'm not saying enough, in his worst humour that evening, namely. Has he had a quarrel, has he discovered a forest offence or what - enough, <character_sound>as Resel calls out to him from afar</character_sound>, he acts as if he hears and sees nothing. She comes to meet him <character_sound>and happily tells him everything</character_sound>, about Father Vitalis' visit and the old woman's consent. Toni plays the fool, acting as if he doesn't understand anything. Consent - to what? He would like to know what he needs permission for. He goes into the house, starts cleaning his rifle, <character_sound>and sings the old song</character_sound> cheekily and exuberantly:

I want to love you,
but not get married."

<character_sound>The countess had straightened up with a jerk</character_sound>: "Bad chap! Miserable man... Oh, that she hadn't gone to him! - So go on, Mr Ruppert."

"As accustomed as Resel was to his uneven humour, at that moment it became too much for her, <character_sound>and she said a few serious words to him</character_sound>. In a moment the poison cock is offended, the sensitive Dalken, and of course this must be punished, the crueler the better. -We will not know this, because there will hardly be such a thing among such high gentlemen; but among us it happens that one must sometimes torment his favourite, whether it is a dog, a horse or a woman, to the point of blood..."

"Oh yes, I know that," <character_sound>sighed the young woman</character_sound>, "you find oddballs like that everywhere. And you still like them."

"Inconceivably so; for at such a moment - I learnt this from Toni - those secteros feel as if the devil had taken their heart in his cursed claws and squeezed it so hard that it becomes like steel... But Your Graces are, it seems to me, sleepy. Shall I not stop?

"Go on, dear head forester."

"When she saw him in such a bad way, she became afraid and anxious, and she doesn't reproach him in the least, only asks humbly: 'Look, take me. Do it out of pity for my good parents But the stubborn goat shakes his head like a sunstroke. He can't think of marrying, and he's too young, and he still wants to enjoy his freedom. <character_sound>At this the Resel becomes quiet</character_sound>."

"And what does she do?"

"Last winter, you know, Toni was attacked in his sleep, bound and gagged, pulled out of bed and thrown out into the snow by three guys with sooty faces, probably punished wood thieves. Thanks to a pure coincidence that led me there at a very unusual time, he wasn't completely frozen to death; he was already three quarters frozen. Since then he has always had a loaded pistol hanging on the wall by the bed. Resel goes up to it, takes it off the nail and says: 'Toni, I have to go home, I promised the spiritual master, but I can't come without you. Will you come with me, Toni?

Everything inside him was trembling because she had such a determined expression, but he wasn't going to let himself be impressed, he, with his Kurash. - 'Are you coming?' - <character_sound>This is no longer a request</character_sound>, <character_sound>and now she threatens</character_sound>: 'Will you?' - <character_sound>He screams</character_sound>, he doesn't know what - he fears that he has shouted: 'No', that the evil one has shouted: 'No' from him, and rushes towards her and wants to snatch the pistols out of her hand. Of course, he should have thought of that earlier. Resel collapses, has shot herself in the chest, the bullet is lodged in her lungs... Now the devil's work is done, now he lets go. Toni's heart opens and his eyes glaze over. He throws himself down beside her... The world, if it were his, namely, heaven, if he had it, he would give everything for her to get well, his beloved, he feels it well: his much-loved. And he fetches blankets and a cushion and lays her on them as carefully as if she were a glass filled to the brim, from which, for God's sake, not a drop may be spilled. <character_sound>But she says with a great effort</character_sound>: 'Go, you are bad... Oh, father - oh, mother!... Oh, you bad one, at least don't let me die like an animal - call me the spiritual Lord'... And he goes away. - A piece of rock, jumping off the steep wall, would not have been down earlier. Without knocking, he rushes into the chaplain's room and finds him not alone, his authority, the dean of Marienhöhe, is sitting with him. Of course, Toni brings his case anyway. Father Vitalis turns pale as a sheet and has to hold on to him so that he doesn't fall over. <character_sound>Yet he says</character_sound>: 'Support me - come', and wants to go into the churches for the Blessed Sacrament; but he can't, he's too weak. The dean leads him to an armchair <character_sound>and asks him exactly</character_sound> what is the matter? <character_sound>Then he says</character_sound>: 'How? To carry the Holy of Holies up to the place where all that is holy has been trampled underfoot? Impossible. First bring the wounded woman back to her parents' house, for penance and atonement...' - 'Yes, bring her', <character_sound>said the chaplain</character_sound>... 'From her parents' house she should come to me as a bride, to receive my priestly blessing for a new path in life; in her parents' house I will give her the travelling food for her last journey

From then on, I did everything myself, walking beside the stretcher on which she was lying and doing nothing but praying. Sometimes I bent down to her. 'Well, how do you feel?' - 'Oh, uncle, as a great sinner

So we took her home and laid her on her mother's bed, because that's what she wanted. She never took her eyes off her, except to look at her father; and she held both their hands in hers <character_sound>and said</character_sound>: 'You...' and again and again: 'You...' It was easy to understand what that meant, namely: You are the good, the best. Nobody loved me like you: I regret! I regret!... Oh, that I didn't have to leave, that I could stay with you. - <character_sound>My brother answered loudly to her mute speeches</character_sound>: 'It will not be a long separation, we will soon follow you." - Now the clergyman approached <character_sound>and spoke to her with marvellous words</character_sound>. <character_sound>Then heard her brief confession</character_sound>, and was just about to absolve her <ambient_sound>when there was a rustling at the door</ambient_sound>. Someone wants to come in and others are trying to keep him out."

"Toni," <character_sound>said the countess</character_sound>.

"Yes. <ambient_sound>You can hear a few people shouting</ambient_sound> and falling down, and the door opens. Nobody looked round, just me. There I see him, kneeling... Your Grace, I've seen a lot in my long life, nothing like this again. The real thief, if he had been taken down from the cross before the divine Saviour had promised him forgiveness - he was his image. I jumped up, took him by the collar and wanted to throw him out. - But he, whom I would otherwise have printed on the wall with one finger, defends himself against me and slides onto his knees right into the middle of the room. <character_sound>His teeth were chattering</character_sound>, thick drops of sweat were running down his cheeks, his eyes were dry as fire. "Resel!" <character_sound>he says</character_sound>, "Forgive me!" She listens. - "Forgive me!" <character_sound>he repeats</character_sound>, dragging himself close to her bed and banging his forehead on the floor. The chaplain turns away, the two parents press their faces into the pillow on which Resel is lying. With one hand she holds her mother round the neck and with the other she points to the thief.

Everything earthly had fallen away from her, she looked at him with such gentle compassion... 'Father - Mother - Reverend... this is a poor man...' And summons up the last of her strength: 'Father - Mother - Reverend, have mercy on him...'

'My child, think now only of the Eternal, before whom you will soon stand', <character_sound>invokes Vitalis</character_sound> - 'think of the salvation of your soul'

<character_sound>But she says</character_sound>: '<character_sound>All my life I have asked for forgiveness</character_sound>, <character_sound>now someone asks me</character_sound>, and I should deny him it?

'Your Saviour, my child, desires to enter your heart - receive your Saviour, my child

'First forgive', <character_sound>she replies</character_sound> and turns her half-broken eyes on the poor sinner: 'I forgive you, Toni, and even if God doesn't forgive me - I forgive you

With that, she's over."

"Dead?"

"Dead, and has missed out on reconciliation with her creator in favour of reconciliation with a human being. - We stand before her, I and the parents, and stare at her in horror, and yet not, because she lies there smiling as peacefully as an innocent child. Father Vitalis came to his senses the earliest, stood up with a marvellous strength, raised his arms to heaven <character_sound>and prayed loudly and fervently</character_sound>: 'Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors'."

"Poor Resel!" <character_sound>said the countess after a long pause</character_sound>... "and what has become of her unfortunate lover, is he still alive? I would like to know him, Toni."

"Know him anyway," <character_sound>retorted the forester</character_sound>. "He's the same one who led His Grace on the hunt today."

"It was him - him?" - Now she came to her senses. The stubbornly silent man with the dark look, whose presence had made her feel almost eerie, had awakened a fleeting, quickly chased away memory in her - the memory of someone it was her duty to forget.
